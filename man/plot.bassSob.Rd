\title{Plot BASS sensitivity indices}
\usage{
\method{plot}{bassSob}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{bassSob} object, returned from \code{sobol}.}

\item{...}{graphical parameters.}
}
\description{
Generate plots for sensitivity analysis of BASS.
}
\details{
If \code{func.var} in the call to \code{sobol} was \code{NULL}, this returns boxplots of sensitivity indices and total sensitivity indices.  If there were functional variables, they are labeled with letters alphabetically.  Thus, if I fit a model with 4 categorical/continuous inputs and 2 functional inputs, the functional inputs are labeled a and b.  If \code{func.var} was not \code{NULL}, then posterior mean functional sensitivity indices are plotted, along with the functional partitioned variance.  Variables and interactions that are excluded did not explain any varaince.
